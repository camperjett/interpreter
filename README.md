# Interpreter
Compiler/Interpreter for Lox Language! (C family syntax)

Hi! This is my try at making my own compiler. I have wanted to to know how programming languages 
actually work under-the-hood and felt that writing a compiler would be great way to do so. For this,
I am following a book called [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) authored by 
Robert Nystrom (who is also an amazing developer!). I aim to develop a complete compiler that goes
all the way up to outputing machine code.

I decided to write this compiler in Java because of two reasons - (1). I have never coded in Java
before. (2). Java is the heart of OOPs!
